# Isometric Map Maker

I am working on an isometric 2d engine as well as a map maker. I would like to be able to iterate quickly on games that I can feel more responsible for desiging (sorry unity)

## How to set up 

Follow this tutorial https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup to ensure you have the correct dependencies (I beleive it's just some JDK version as I was able to download this repo and go on my mac with no need for the libgdx manager)


## Development Videos



One of the second or third builds of this project. Able to place tiles down in a grid, unable to place walls ontop of tiles. A lot of the earlier commits were adding core compenents like assets for ui and the game.

Building walls ontop of floor tiles. Multiple layers availble. Realizing that I will want to be able to place 4 walls on a tile

4 walls can be placed, however it is extremely unintuitive to do so at this point

Better ui, visually able to determine what the nearby options will be

**CURRENT** Placing walls no intuitive.
